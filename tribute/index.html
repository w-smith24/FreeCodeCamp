        <p>Linus Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland. His parent, Anna and Nils Torvalds, were both journalists. Torvalds claims that he was named after Linus Pauling, an Nobel Prize-winning American Chemist, and Linus from the Peanuts cartoon.</p>

        <h2>1981-1991</h2>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <p>Torvalds interest in computers begins with the Commodore VIC-20. He started coding in BASIC and later used machine code to directly access the CPU. He eventually purchased a Sinclair QL which he used to modify the operating system. He wrote his own assembler and editor as well as a Pac-Man clone called Cool Man. In 1991 he purchased an Intel 80386 PC which he used to start working on Linux. The first prototypes were released later that year.</p>

        <p>Torvalds was taken to University of Technology to listen to Richard Stallman, a free software guru, speak. This is when he first comes into contact with the GNU Project. He would go on to use the GNU General Public License version 2 for his Linux kernel. Version 1.0 of the Linux Kernel was released on March 14, 1994.</p>

        <p>Torvalds visited Transmeta, in California, and would eventually work there from February 2007 until June 2003. He was involved with 86open from 1997 to 1999 choosing the standard binary format for Linus and Unix. He was named one of the world's top innovators in 1999 by <em>MIT Technology Review TR100</em> Also in 1999, he was given stock options from Red Hat and VA Linux as gratitude for him creating Linux. His share value would shoot up to $20 million later that year when both companies went public.</p>
